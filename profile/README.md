## Welcome to Terramate! 👋 👋🏿 👋🏻 👋🏽

We are a team of technologists and practitioners who believe the cloud enables innovation. Infrastructure as Code stands
in the center of the once-in-a-generation shift to the cloud, and we are helping organizations of all sizes, from 
well-known brands to ambitious start-ups, to adopt, operate and scale IaC so they can focus on innovating!

### 💻 Terramate CLI

[Terramate CLI](https://github.com/terramate-io/terramate) is an open source tool that supercharges Terraform with Stacks,
Orchestration, Git Integration, Code Generation, Data Sharing and more. It focuses on improving the Developer Experience
(DX), providing workflows, and lowering the time spent writing and maintaining infrastructure code for projects at any scale.

### ☁️ Terramate Cloud

With Terramate Cloud, we're launching a new Cloud Asset Management Platform built on our popular open-source tool Terramate. Terramate Cloud will enable teams to manage and observe all their cloud assets, automatically import and codify non-IaC managed assets, and detect and resolve drifts to prevent service failures.

We're working on Terramate Cloud and aim to launch in Q4 2023. If you want to become a design partner, please fill out the
